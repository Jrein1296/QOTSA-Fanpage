    <p>
      QOTSA is the best band ever.  I can't see how this is even open for debate.  Smokin' guitars.  Galactic bass.  Drums like a pre-COVID-19 Bastille day celebration.  All this, and you can dance to it.  Well, most of it anyway.

    <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>Queens of the Stonage were born in a different time; a time when shredding guitars vanquished their enemies.  A time when men with beards and flannel shirts wielded huge double-bit felling axes; they knew nothing of craft beers and hard lemonade and were all the better for it.  A time when pop musicians were still embarrased to be themselves.  </p>
